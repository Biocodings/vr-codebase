This repository contains the internally-developed software used by the
Vertebrate Resequencing group a the Sanger Institute.

It comprises mostly self-documented Perl code. There are both scripts and 
modules within subfolders.

Each module has its own POD, so please use perldoc or similar for further help.
Eg:
$ perldoc VertRes::Utils::Sam

An overview, guides and how-tos will soon be available on the github wiki:
https://github.com/VertebrateResequencing/vr-codebase/wiki



INSTALLATION
------------

You will need the source version of samtools compiled with -fPIC and -m64 in the
CFLAGS, and the environment variable SAMTOOLs pointing to that source directory
(which should now contain bam.h and libbam.a).
It is also recommended that you set PERL_INLINE_DIRECTORY to ~/.Inline


$ perl Build.PL

If this says you have "ERRORS/WARNINGS FOUND IN PREREQUISITES" try:
$ ./Build installdeps
to install missing prerequisites from CPAN.

To test the code prior to use:

$ perl Build.PL
$ ./Build test

To install:
$ ./Build install
(or just point your PERL5LIB to the modules subdirectory)
